# What is Crust?

Crust brings your user ecosystem and essential applications together on one
platform, unifying them via Compose, Team Messaging and Advanced Identity and Access Management.

[Crust](https://www.crust.tech) is an enterprise distribution of [Corteza Project](https://github.com/cortezaproject).

**Crust Messaging** 
is a secure, high performance, open source Slack alternative that allows your 
teams to collaborate more efficiently, as well as communicate safely with other 
organisations or customers.

**Crust Compose** 
is an open source Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Low Code Development platform
for custom web based business applications like CRM, intranet or employee self service 
portals. Deliver the application you need more  easily and faster then ever before with 
the drag and drop page builder, protect users with integrated Identity, Access and 
Privacy Management, and automate tasks with Compose’s advanced automation functionality. 
Compose is easy, fast and secure – your perfect ally to digitize your organisation’s 
business processes and customer engagement.

**Crust Unify** 
manages user experience for Crust applications, such as Compose 
and Messaging, as well as providing an integrated interface for third party or 
other bespoke applications. 100% responsive and with an intuitive design, Crust 
Unify increases productivity and ease of access to all IT resources.
